## Wood test
A small image-based quiz for identifying types of wood made with React.  The idea for this came up between some other students and I in our woodworking class.

### Stack
- React
- Webpack v2
- Mocha/chai/enzyme
- Eslint

### Use
1.) Clone the repo

2.) Install dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install`.

3.) Run the dev server with `yarn run start` or build with `yarn run build`.

4.) Run the tests with `yarn run test`.

5.) Lint the code with `yarn run lint:watch`.

### TODO
- Style it!
- Add more types of wood and randomize them on load
